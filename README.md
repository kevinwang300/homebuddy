# homebuddy

## Getting started
For this project we will be using React to create our web app! If you do not have node/npm installed, click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)!

To run the web app, clone this repository on your terminal, and run:
```
cd homebuddy
npm start
```

Since we are going to be writing javascript code for our app, I recommend downloading Webstorm, which is essentially Intellij or Pycharm for javascript! However, since Webstorm is not usually free (it usually has a 30 day free trial), we are going to get a [JetBrains student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) using our Berkeley emails! Follow the instructions and create a JetBrains account.

After creating the account, we can download Webstorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac). Once you have downloaded and started up Webstorm, click through everything until you reach the login page. At this point, log in using the JetBrains account that you just created, and you should now be able to use Webstorm to work on the app!
