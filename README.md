# homebuddy

## Getting started
For this project we will be using React to create our web app! If you do not have node/npm installed, click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)!

To run the web app, clone this repository on your terminal, and run:
```
cd homebuddy
npm start
```

Since we are going to be writing javascript code for our app, I recommend downloading Webstorm, which is essentially Intellij or Pycharm for javascript! However, since Webstorm is not usually free (it usually has a 30 day free trial), we are going to get a [JetBrains student license](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/) using our Berkeley emails! Follow the instructions and create a JetBrains account.

After creating the account, we can download Webstorm [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/#section=mac) and begin to write code for our app!
